 Often virtual theads are created in such large numbers and frequency
 that they can overwhelm a debugger.
 For this reason by default JDB does not keep track of virtual threads as
 they are created.
 It will only keep track of virtual threads that an event has arrived on,
 such as a breakpoint event.

 When JDB first connects, it requests a list of all known threads from
 the Debug Agent.
 By default the debug agent does not return any virtual threads in this
 list, once again because the list could be so large that it overwhelms
 the debugger.

 However, keep in mind that the Debug Agent may not know about any
 virtual threads that were created before JDB attached to the debugged
 application.
